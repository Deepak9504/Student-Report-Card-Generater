# Student Report Card Generator

## Project Overview

The *Student Report Card Generator* is a Java-based application designed to automate the process of generating academic report cards. By inputting student details and marks, the application calculates the total marks, percentage, grade, and pass/fail status, generating a well-formatted report card. This project aims to reduce manual calculations and errors, streamlining the process for educational institutions.

The system is designed with core Java principles, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), error handling, and file management, and offers a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Additionally, it incorporates error handling and modular design for future extensibility.

## Features

### Core Features:
- *Student Information Input*: Allows input of student name, roll number, and class.
- *Marks Entry*: Enables entry of subject-wise marks.
- *Total Marks and Percentage Calculation*: Automatically computes total marks and percentage.
- *Grade Assignment*: Dynamically assigns grades based on the percentage.
- *Pass/Fail Status*: Displays whether the student has passed or failed.
- *Report Card Generation*: Outputs a formatted report card to the console.

### Additional Features:
- *Input Validation*: Ensures that marks entered are within the valid range (0-100).
- *File Handling*: Optionally saves the report card as a text file for easy printing and record-keeping.
- *Extensibility*: Modular structure allowing easy addition of features like subject customization or a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Technologies Used
- *Java* (JDK 8 or higher)
- *Text Editor/IDE* (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- *Command Line Interface (CLI)*

## Code Structure

The code is divided into separate classes to manage different aspects of the report card generation process:

1. *Student Class*: Handles student information, marks, and grade calculation.
2. *Input Module*: Manages user input for student details and marks.
3. *Processing Module*: Calculates total marks, percentage, and assigns grades.
4. *Output Module*: Displays the report card to the user.
5. *ReportCardGenerator Class*: Main class coordinating the flow of the application.

### Example of Code Structure:

```java
class Student {
    String name;
    int rollNumber;
    String className;
    int[] marks;
    int total = 0;
    double percentage;
    String grade;
    boolean isPass = true;
  
    void inputDetails(Scanner sc) {
    }

    void inputMarks(Scanner sc, int subjects) {
    }

    void calculateGrade() {
    }

    void printReport() {
    }
}

public class ReportCardGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

##  Error Handling & Robustness*  

The application implements robust error handling to ensure stability and a smooth user experience. Here are the key mechanisms:  

###  Input Validation*  
- *Marks Range Check: Ensures subject marks are between **0–100*.  
  java
  if (marks[i] < 0 || marks[i] > 100) {
      System.out.println(" Invalid marks! Please enter a value between 0 and 100.");
      i--; // Re-prompt for the same subject
      continue;
  }
  
- *Numeric Input Check*: Prevents crashes from non-numeric entries.  
  java
  try {
      marks[i] = sc.nextInt();
  } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
      System.out.println(" Invalid input! Please enter numbers only.");
      sc.next(); // Clear invalid input
      i--; // Re-prompt
  }
  

###  Defensive Programming*  
- *Null/Empty Checks*: Validates required fields (e.g., student name, roll number).  
- *Division Safety*: Ensures no division by zero in percentage calculations.  
- *Default Values*: Initializes variables to prevent NullPointerException.  

###  Resource Management*  
- *Auto-closing Scanner*: Prevents memory leaks.  
  java
  try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) {
      // Input handling
  }
  

###  User-Friendly Feedback*  
- Clear error messages guide users to correct inputs.  
- Loop-based re-prompting ensures smooth recovery from errors.

##  Why It Matters*  
- *Prevents crashes* from invalid inputs.  
- *Guides users* with actionable feedback.  
- *Ensures data integrity* with rigorous validation.  
# Integration of Components in Student Report Card Generator

## Modular System Architecture

The application follows a modular design pattern with clearly separated responsibilities:

### Core Components

1. *Student Class*
   - Central data storage for student information (name, roll number, class)
   - Handles marks processing and grade calculations
   - Contains methods for input validation and data processing

2. *Input Module*
   - Manages all user input operations
   - Validates data before passing to processing module
   - Includes scanner handling and input prompts

3. *Processing Module*
   - Performs calculations (total marks, percentage)
   - Determines grades based on percentage
   - Evaluates pass/fail status

4. *Output Module*
   - Formats and displays the final report card
   - Handles console output formatting
   - (Optional) Manages file output operations

### Data Flow Management

The system maintains a clean data flow between components:

1. *Main Class (ReportCardGenerator)*
   - Creates Student class instance
   - Coordinates component interaction
   - Manages program lifecycle

2. *Execution Sequence*
   java
   Student s = new Student();
   s.inputDetails(sc);      // Input Module
   s.inputMarks(sc);        // Input Module
   s.assignGrade();         // Processing Module
   s.displayReportCard();   // Output Module
   

3. *Error Handling Integration*
   - Validation occurs at input stage
   - Processing methods assume clean data
   - Output methods handle final formatting

### Design Advantages

1. *Single Responsibility Principle*
   - Each class/method handles one specific task
   - Makes debugging and testing easier

2. *Loose Coupling*
   - Components interact through well-defined interfaces
   - Changes to one module rarely affect others

3. *Extensibility*
   - New features can be added with minimal changes
   - Easy to implement GUI/database versions

4. *Maintainability*
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Logical organization of code
# Event Handling and Processing

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Core Event Handling Components

1. *Action Listeners*
   - Attached to interactive components (buttons, input fields)
   - Trigger specific operations when activated
   - Example implementation:
     java
     submitButton.addActionListener(e -> processInput());
     calculateButton.addActionListener(e -> calculateResults());
     resetButton.addActionListener(e -> resetForm());
     

2. *Event Delegation Model*
   - Centralized event processing for better performance
   - Single listeners handle multiple related components
   - Reduces redundant code and improves maintainability

### Processing Workflow

1. *Input Phase*
   - Events capture user data (student details, marks)
   - Immediate validation occurs on field exit/button press
   - Invalid inputs trigger error messages without processing

2. *Calculation Phase*
   - Triggered by Calculate/Submit actions
   - Performs:
     - Total marks summation
     - Percentage calculation
     - Grade determination
     - Pass/Fail evaluation

3. *Output Phase*
   - Generates formatted report card
   - Handles display or file output
   - Resets form for next entry (if applicable)

### Performance Optimization

1. *Efficient Event Management*
   - Listeners are added only where necessary
   - Lightweight lambda expressions reduce memory overhead
   - Unused listeners are properly removed

2. *Responsive UI*
   - Long-running tasks are offloaded from main thread
   - Progress indicators for intensive operations
   - Immediate feedback for user actions

3. *Error Recovery*
   - Failed operations provide clear recovery paths
   - Data integrity maintained during partial failures
   - User context preserved after errors

## Implementation Benefits

- *Consistency*: Uniform handling of similar events across application
- *Maintainability*: Clear separation between event triggers and actions
- *Extensibility*: New event types can be added without restructuring
- *User Experience*: Immediate feedback for all interactions
